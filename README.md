# OdourCollect - Technical Exercise

## Development of the Technical Exercise

### Technical Exercise Description

The technical exercise involves creating a set of React components related to odor perception and intensity. Two main screens were developed:

1. **LandingPage:** A landing page that contains information about the "OdourCollect" application.

2. **OdourObservatory (Map with Odor Filters):** A screen that displays an interactive map where users can search and select locations related to odor perception. Additionally, this screen includes input sliders for odor intensity filters.

### Implemented Solution

1. **Map Component with Search:** Implemented a component that uses the map API to display an interactive map on the OdourObservatory screen. Integrated search functionality allows users to search for specific locations and highlight them on the map.

2. **Odor Filter Input Component:** Developed a component that allows users to select odor intensity using a set of slider inputs.

3. **CSS Styles:** Applied CSS styles to format and design the map component, search, and odor filter inputs, ensuring proper display on different screen sizes.

4. **Routes and Navigation:** Implemented the necessary routes for the LandingPage and OdourObservatory, enabling access from different parts of the application.

### Next Steps

It is recommended to perform integration testing and thorough code review to ensure its quality and proper functioning. Additionally, consider implementing unit tests to guarantee the good performance of the map component, search, and odor filter inputs.
